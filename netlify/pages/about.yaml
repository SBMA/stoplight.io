        Having all the tools to model, test, and document our API in one place, and integrating it nicely along the
        entire CI/CD workflow process has been extremely helpful for us.

        Stoplight provides a clean user interface and enables an engineering team to develop a compliant API with
        minimal difficulty. Other tools don't provide the same details, guard rails, and error validation that Stoplight
        provides.

        Our team roughly saves 15-20 hours a week. It makes it quicker to write, and the review process is quicker as
        well because we can go in and everybody can see the edits. We're pretty impressed with Stoplight as a whole.
