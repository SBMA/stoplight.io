  description: Don't see your question? [Talk to a solutions engineer](https://stoplight.io/demo).

  questions:
    - question: What is a Stoplight User?
      answer: >-
        A Stoplight user is any user able to log in to a Stoplight workspace.
    - question: What is a project?
      answer: >-
        A Stoplight project represents a git repository.
    - question: What happens when adding users mid-cycle?
      answer: >-
        Weâ€™ll make a one-time, prorated charge to your credit card to cover new user accounts for 
        the remainder of the current billing period. At the end 
        of each monthly billing cycle, you will be billed for the upcoming month's 
        subscription based on the exact number of Stoplight users.
    - question: Do you offer annual billing?
      answer: >-
        Yes, we offer annual billing. Please email sales@stoplight.io.
    - question: Do you offer discounts for Open Source projects?
      answer: >-

    - question: Do you offer discounts for non profits?
      answer: >-
        Yes, we offer 50% off team plans for non profits. Please contact support@stoplight.io.
    - question: How secure is the Stoplight platform?
      answer: >-
        Our [hosted platform](https://stoplight.io/TBD) is monitored around the clock by a dedicated team of engineers. 
        Our servers run on Google Kubernetes Engine and are configured in accordance with their recommended best practices, 
        and all of the data we store is encrypted. Both our hosted platform and our on-premise artifacts receive security 
        patches at least once a month (but often more). Access to critical infrastructure and data is restricted to a small 
        handful of engineers according to a strict need-based policy. Our on-premise artifacts are designed to never transfer 
        or store sensitive data in cleartext, support running as non-root or with random UID, and are compatible with linux 
        security systems like SELinux or AppArmor. We offer artifacts in several distributions and have experience working 
        with enterprise security teams to meet their unique requirements.
