    Thousands of companies use Stoplight to streamline their API & Microservices
    workflow
faq:
  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  description: Don't see your question? [Talk to a solutions engineer](https://stoplight.io/demo).

  questions:
    - question: How is usage calculated?
      answer: >-
        In Stoplight, APIs are organized into workspaces. Each workspace is associated with a user account's billing profile.
        Your usage is the sum of the users and resources across all of the workspaces connected to your billing profile.
    - question: What happens if I go over my limits?
      answer: >-
        Nothing will be disabled or changed immediately. You will receive an email asking you to updating your billing, or lower your usage.
        If, after 7 days, you have not updated your billing, the associated workspaces will be disabled until your account is back in good standing.
    - question: How many APIs can I publish with the Standard and PRO plans?
      answer: >-
        No limits! As long as you are within your 2,500 free resources, you can publish as many APIs as you like. We do not charge for anything on a per api basis - see the FAQ below for our rationale.
    - question: What is counted as a user?
      answer: >-
        Anyone invited to your workspaces in the Stoplight app is considered a user of that workspace. Only unique users are counted 
        towards your billing profile. If you invite the same user to multiple workspaces, it still counts as one user. 
        Users with the guest role are counted and applied to your limits.
    - question: Can I transfer a workspace to another billing account?
      answer: >-
        Absolutely, just head over to the billing section of the workspace in question, and then scroll down to the transfer section.
    - question: Is my credit card information secure?
      answer: >-
        Yes. All credit card processing is handled through Stripe, and your card information is never sent to, or stored on, our servers.
    - question: What is a "Resource"?
      answer: >-
        All the different parts that make up your API design and tests are considered resources.
    - question: I'm working on an open source, education, or non-profit project. Is there a discount?
      answer: >-
        Let's chat! Please send an email to customer@stoplight.io.
    - question: Why not measure usage on a per API basis?
      answer: >-
        Many other tools price on a per API basis, instead of per resource. 
        We believe that a resource based model is more flexible and fair, particularly as the industry moves towards 
        smaller and smaller services (microservices). One 1000 endpoint API should be priced the same as one hundred 10 endpoint APIs
    - question: Is there a free trial?
      answer: >-
        Yes. Every new account gets 14 days to try all of our tools, without limits.
