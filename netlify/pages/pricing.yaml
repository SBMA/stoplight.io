  description: Don't see your question? [Talk to a solutions engineer](https://stoplight.io/demo).

  questions:
    - question: Which users count toward the per-user pricing?
      description: >-
        All users that can log in to your Stoplight workspace except guest users count toward the per-user pricing. 
        Guest users are part of the Professional and Enterprise plans only. Anonymous users accessing your documentation 
        are not counted toward the per-user pricing and are part of all plans.
    - question: What is a project?
      description: >-
        A Stoplight project represents a Git repository.  Projects can contain multiple 
        API descriptions, schemas, documentation, and even your source code.
      even: true
    - question: Which Git providers are supported by Stoplight?
      description: >-
        Stoplight currently integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. 
        Support for other Git providers like Azure DevOps Server will be coming soon. 
        Please check out our [roadmap](https://stoplight.io/p/roadmap) for more information.
    - question: Do you offer annual billing?
      description: >-
        Yes! For annual billing, please contact us at sales@stoplight.io. The default billing cycle for Stoplight is monthly. 
    - question: Do you offer discounts for Nonprofits or Open Source projects?
      description: >-
        Yes! We offer a free Starter plan for Open Source projects or organizations involved in COVID-19 
        relief efforts, while Nonprofits can get our Starter plan at 50% off. Please contact us at 
        support@stoplight.io to get started.
    - question: What happens when adding users mid-cycle?
      description: >-
        We’ll make a one-time, prorated charge to your credit card to cover new user accounts for 
        the remainder of the current billing period. At the end 
        of each monthly billing cycle, you will be billed for the upcoming month’s 
        subscription-based on the exact number of Stoplight users.
      even: true
    - question: How secure is the Stoplight platform?
      description: >-
        Our hosted platform is monitored around the clock by a dedicated team of engineers. 
        Our servers run on Google Kubernetes Engine and are configured in accordance with their recommended best practices,
        and all of the data we store is encrypted. Both the hosted platform and our on-premise artifacts receive security 
        patches at least once a month (but often more). According to strict need-based policy, access to critical 
        infrastructure and data is restricted to a handful of engineers. Our on-premise artifacts are designed to never
         transfer or store sensitive data in cleartext, support running as non-root or with random UID, and are compatible 
         with Linux security systems like SELinux or AppArmor. We offer artifacts in several distributions and have experience 
         working with enterprise security teams to meet their unique requirements.
