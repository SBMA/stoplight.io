# Free API Testing Tool

It has become increasingly important to develop highly flexible, performant, and powerful testing roadmaps to catch bugs faster and rapidly iterate. Stoplight provides a complete set of free API testing tools that include a free REST API testing tool, free web API testing tools, and much more.  A thorough test suite is essential for: 

* Assessing the health of an API
* Providing [valuable documentation](https://stoplight.io/documentation) 
* [Driving design](https://stoplight.io/design) and implementation 
* Managing technical debt 



> [Stoplight’s Scenarios](https://stoplight.io/testing) is a free API testing tool that supports OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger).



## Assessing the Health of an API

APIs require maintenance like any other software. To ensure that your API is functioning properly, a suite of tests should be run periodically to check for weaknesses and errors.

> Create and [run tests within Stoplight](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/running-tests/in-stoplight), [the terminal](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/running-tests/in-the-terminal), or [trigger it by URL](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/running-tests/triggering-by-url). If you prefer to [use Stoplight with Continuous Integration providers](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/continuous-integration/overview), Stoplight also provides integrations with [Jenkins](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/continuous-integration/jenkins), [CircleCI](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/continuous-integration/circle-ci), and [Travis](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/continuous-integration/travis).

## Providing Valuable Documentation & Driving Design

API tests provide insight into how your API behaves under certain scenarios and can drive design if created early enough in the design process. Test/Behavior-driven development (TDD/BDD) encourages you to think about design requirements before writing any code. 

> Stoplight further promotes this design-first principle by providing [Contract Testing](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/leveraging-openapi/contract-testing); tests that ensure the API implementation meets the standards and definitions described in a “contract” or specification. This allows for immediate validation and verification that your API responses match the contract specified in your OpenAPI Specification. With integrated Contract Testing reporting capabilities, you can track your progress towards 100% coverage

## Managing Technical Debt

Microservice architecture has made it easier than ever to iterate quickly. The downside of rapid development is an increase in bugs and technical debt, making projects harder to manage without a proper testing solution. It is critical to have a comprehensive test suite to allow teams to test the API during development. 



> Stoplight makes it easier to create a full suite of tests by providing [Environment](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/using-variables/environment) and [Context variables](https://docs.stoplight.io/testing/using-variables/context), and the ability to reference other scenarios to accelerate test generation and reduce duplication
