    Large enterprises embarking on Digital API transformation are increasingly
    relying on API Design Management platforms in addition to traditional API
    Management to supercharge their business workflow.<br>

    Poor API designs lead to poor service implementation and documentation which
    significantly impacts any Digital API transformation.<br>

    We believe this is why Gartner named Stoplight a Cool Vendor in Application
    Development. This comprehensive report dives into the breadth of the
    Stoplight API Design Management platform. It covers:<br><br>


    ### API Design as a critical part of the lifecycle journey.


    Model, collaborate, and automate - don’t manually manage thousands of lines
    of API spec using a text editor. Stoplight’s extensible modeling technology
    is core to the Stoplight platform which has purpose built automation for OAS
    (fka Swagger) and JSON Schema models and was designed to grow to accommodate
    future API standards, backed by a git foundation.<br><br>


    ### The role of collaboration in speed to deploy and error reduction.


    Enforce standards & reuse across your teams. Leverage best practices
    immediately, easily share common API artifacts, and report on adoption of
    enterprise standards.<br><br>


    ### Automation in keeping design and implementation in sync for the
    Enterprise.


    Integrate with your CI/CD, optimize your documentation with SSO, and enable
    tech heavy teams with on-prem and local desktop support.<br><br>


    ### Creating up to date, beautiful documentation by having the designs be
    the single source of truth.


    Create engaging API Documentation Hubs, not auto generated lists of
    endpoints with no style. Quickly create compelling developer experiences for
    API consumers by pulling together multiple APIs into contextual Hubs. Each
    “API Hub” can target different audiences and use cases by reusing and
    reconfiguring existing content.

        We decided to go for Stoplight because we are convinced that the API
        must be held by the business people (product owners). Before, they were
        used to designing processes or UI screens. Now, the screens are made by
        UX experts or by fintechs using our APIs. So, the product owners have to
        design the API, it's an important change, not all of them are ready.
        This is why a graphical tools is a good opportunity, perhaps the only
        one, to involve them in the design of API.
