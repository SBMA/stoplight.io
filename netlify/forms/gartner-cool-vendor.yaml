    Large enterprises embarking on a Digital API transformation to supercharge their business increasingly need API Design Management in addition to traditional API Management to make this happen.<br>

    Poor API designs lead to poor service implementation and documentation which significantly impacts any Digital API transformation.<br>

    We believe this is why Gartner named Stoplight a Cool Vendor in Application Development. This comprehensive report dives into the breadth of the Stoplight API Design Management platform. It covers:<br><br>

    ### API Design as a critical part of the lifecycle journey.

    Model, collaborate, and automate - don’t manually manage thousands of lines of API spec using a text editor. Stoplight’s extensible modeling technology is core to the Stoplight platform which has purpose built automation for OAS (fka Swagger) and JSON Schema models and was designed to grow to accommodate future API standards, backed by a git foundation.<br><br>

    ### The role of collaboration in speed to deploy and error reduction.

    Enforce standards & reuse across your teams. Leverage best practices quickly, share common API artifacts easily, and report on adoption of enterprise standards.<br><br>

    ### Automation in keeping design and implementation in sync for the Enterprise.

    Developers and enterprise IT are our partners. SSO, bring your own tooling, integrate to CI/CD, with on premises and local desktop options allowing tech heavy teams to have it their way.<br><br>

    ### Creating up to date, beautiful documentation by having the designs be the single source of truth.

    Create engaging API Documentation Hubs, not auto generated lists of endpoints with no style.
    Quickly create compelling developer experiences for API consumers by pulling together multiple APIs into contextual Hubs. Each “API Hub” can target different audiences and use cases by reusing and reconfiguring existing content.

        We decided to go for Stoplight because we are convinced that the API must be held by the business people (product owners). Before, they were used to designing processes or UI screens. Now, the screens are made by UX experts or by fintechs using our APIs. So, the product owners have to design the API, it's an important change, not all of them are ready. This is why a graphical tools is a good opportunity, perhaps the only one, to involve them in the design of API.
