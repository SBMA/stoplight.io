    Large enterprises embarking on Digital API transformation initiatives are
    increasingly relying on API Design Management platforms in addition to
    traditional API Management solutions to supercharge their business.<br>

    Poor API designs lead to poor service implementations and documentation
    which can slow down service delivery and negatively impact the ROI of the
    initiative.<br>


    We believe this is why _Gartner_ named _Stoplight_ a **Cool Vendor in
    Application Development and Platforms.** This report highlights
    _Stoplight’s_ API Design Management platform.<br><br>


    ### API Design


    Model, collaborate, and automate - don’t manually manage thousands of lines
    of API spec using a text editor. _Stoplight’s_ extensible visual modeling
    technology is central to the _Stoplight_ platform which has purpose-built
    automation for OpenAPI (fka Swagger) and JSON Schema specifications backed
    by git.<br><br>


    ### API Collaboration


    Collaborate, share, and validate your API Designs. Leverage best practices
    quickly, share common API artifacts easily, and report on API Style Guide
    adoption across the organization.<br><br>


    ### API Testing


    Automate your contract testing.  Ensure that your API Design and your
    implementation are in synch.<br><br>


    ### API Documentation


    Automatic indexing of your API Designs ensures all of your documentation is
    up to date.  In addition, a cross organizational “API Design Catalog” is
    auto-generated for quick and efficient searching of API Design
    artifacts.<br><br>

        Our team roughly saves 15-20 hours a week. It makes it quicker to write, and the review process is quicker as well because we can go in and everybody can see the edits.  We're pretty impressed with Stoplight as a whole.
