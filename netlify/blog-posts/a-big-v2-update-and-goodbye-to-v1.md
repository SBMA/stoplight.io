Thanks to all who participated in the beta of our version 2 tooling! We received a tremendous amount of feedback, and it was a great success. Weâ€™ve turned that feedback into our final big v2 update, which is rolling out today.

**Important Dates**

* **August 18th:** Shutdown of v1, free beta of v2 ends (billing is enforced now).

* **August 19th, 9PM PST:** 30 minutes of scheduled maintenance on the Stoplight app, during which it will not be available. Documentation hosted with API Docs will not be affected.

**Updates to v2**

This update combines the left nav and sidebars into a single column, with much clearer navigational elements. It also fixes a slew of bugs, and introduces a few new features, some of which include:

* Shared models & design at the workspace level. While this was available in the initial v2 release, it was quite hidden and most users did not notice it.

* Spec import when creating new API versions.

* A new learn area.

* A new prism settings panel.

**Immediate Plans**

We will be focusing our efforts on the following 5 areas:

* Writing articles and producing videos, covering a variety of topics related to the Stoplight tooling.

* Implementing long requested smaller features, some of which include custom (and multiple) mimetypes, and swagger extension support.

* Improving our API specification support, and allowing for direct specification editing within Stoplight.

* Improving API docs.

* Github sync.
