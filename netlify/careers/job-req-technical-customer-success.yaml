    ### Stoplight is looking for a Customer Success Engineer (CSE) to join a fast growing Austin startup in the exciting domain of APIs and API Design Management. 

    The CSE position is a technical customer-facing role with a focus on helping customers achieve success in their use of the Stoplight product. You will work with customers by helping answer questions, solving problems, and ultimately being the voice of the customer within Stoplight.

    ### What is Stoplight?


    Stoplight helps organizations design, document, test, collaborate and

    working with an API more productive. We work with individual developers to large companies 
    including EA, Spotify, Sendgrid, and many others.


    ### Why are we doing this?


    We created Stoplight because we found existing API solutions tools 
    to be inadequate. After talking with thousands of users and growing 
    to 500+ paying customers, itâ€™s clear there is a massive void for 
    Stoplight to become the must-have workflow solution for any organization 
    looking to streamline their API strategy.

    - Answer questions, troubleshoot problems, and provide deep technical support for Stoplight customers across a wide array of topics.

    - Deliver a great customer service experience with each customer interaction

    - Assist in writing, reviewing, and maintaining Stoplight product documentation

    - Participate in a working hours on-call rotation for urgent customer issues

    - Serve as the voice of the customer within Stoplight

    ### Requirements

    - Solid understanding of the modern web application stack. You are familiar with one or more of the following technologies: Typescript, React, GraphQL, REST, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes/Docker, nginx

    - Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to work and interact in a group or team

    - Strong problem-solving skills, with the ability to independently troubleshoot problems and identify workarounds

    ### About 

    Headquartered in Austin, Texas, our team hails from across 
    the US and Europe, and is united by our passion for APIs. 
    From skeeball champions to rock climbers, tough mudders to 
    restaurateurs, each and every member brings their own unique 
    perspectives and experiences to the table. Thinking out of the 
    box is our purpose - the weirder the better - and challenging 
    the status quo is our culture.
