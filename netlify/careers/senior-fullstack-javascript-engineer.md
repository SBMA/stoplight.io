Stoplight is looking for a senior full-stack engineer with an initial focus on several projects involving our React frontend. We're growing fast looking to bring on exceptional team members to make an impact on how software teams build products.

## What is Stoplight?

Stoplight helps organizations design, document, test, collaborate and govern their APIs. We are the first product to effectively cover the entire API development lifecycle.

Stoplight’s mission is to make any stakeholder working with an API more productive. We work with individual developers to large companies including EA, Spotify, Sendgrid, and many others.

## Why are we doing this?

We created Stoplight because we found existing API solutions tools to be inadequate. After talking with thousands of users and growing to 500+ paying customers, it’s clear there is a massive void for Stoplight to become the must-have workflow solution for any organization looking to streamline their API strategy.

## What does it take to be successful in this role?

- You consider yourself one of the top React and/or Node.js at your current or past role. Experience with Typescript and GraphQL a plus.
- You understand how to architect and scale complicated technical problems.
- You thrive in a highly collaborative environment.
- You are curious and have a willingness to learn from/teach your colleagues.
- Passionate about user experience.
- You have a constant curiosity to grow your skills beyond the workplace.
- You love boiling complicated problems down to simple solutions.

## Benefits

- Competitive Salary & Equity
- Health, Dental, & Vision
- 401(k) with company contribution
- Generous PTO
- Dog Friendly Office
- Parental Leave & Support

## About

Headquartered in Austin, Texas, our team hails from across the US and Europe, and is united by our passion for APIs. From skeeball champions to rock climbers, tough mudders to restaurateurs, each and every member brings their own unique perspectives and experiences to the table. Thinking out of the box is our purpose - the weirder the better - and challenging the status quo is our culture.
