        Stoplight offers multiple ways for your API consumers to try out your
        API. Test Requests within your documentation allows consumers to
        understand how your API works. Code Examples generated from dozens of
        languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, cURL, and more allow
        consumers to copy and paste right into their own code.

        solution that works for you. Allow Stoplight to host your documentation
        for you, as hosted documentation means you never have to worry about managing servers for your
        documentation ever again. Manage access control and measure analytics
        with integrations. [Our enterprise ready documentation
        tool](/documentation/enterprise/) allows you to download the static
        assets or use our on-premise solutions behind your firewall to host your
        documentation from anywhere.
